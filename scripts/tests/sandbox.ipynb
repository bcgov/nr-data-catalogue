It was noted as a concern `that, with databases scattered among ministries, there is no easy manner in which information on contaminated sites can be consolidated, updated and analyzed to provide a province-wide perspective.`   One of the recommendations was that the `process should include a province-wide prioritization of contaminated sites so that scarce funds can be allocated where they will achieve the greatest reduction in risk.`   The government`s response was that the `Ministry of Sustainable Resource Management will continue with the development of a central registry of crown land and related database including contaminated site status as part of its mandate for integrated information.`  This project is the first step towards that goal.\",\n",

Ministry of Forests has surveyed the majority of the forested land in the province using the classic sketch mapping technique known as the the overview survey method.  The purpose of the survey is to record and report the general trends in disturbance patterns across the provincial forested land base (including provincial parks, private land, and Tree Farm Licences but not Federal parks).  The survey has been a key source of data documenting the development of the current mountain pine beetle outbreak in the interior of B.C.  Data from the BC MOF survey is also comparable to data collected from 1914 to 1995 by the Canadian Forest Service`s former Forest Insect and Disease Survey Unit (FIDS) and to US Forest Service, Forest Health monitoring surveys.  This model provides spatial data to the current and past conditions reported by the survey, the survey methods and other supporting information\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four spatial layers in the Forest health Model are described as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Pest Infestation polygon - Polygons depict the  severity of detected forest health factors (pests) using the aerial and ground forest health surveys by area.  Themes are displayed by pest species and by the year of data collection. Feature type : polygon multipart.\\r\\n2. Pest Infestation Overview polygon - A generalized version of the Pest Infestation Polygon layer.  Feature type : polygon multipart.\\r\\n3. Pest Infestation points - Points depict the location of detected forest health factors (pests) using the aerial and ground forest health surveys.  Themes are displayed by pest species and by the year of data collection. Feature type : point.\\r\\n4. Pest Hazard - This theme depicts that relative susceptibility (hazard) of forested areas to damage by pests.  The hazard polygons are generated using various means ranging from biogeoclimatic zonation and degree-day accumulations, to professional opinion based on the synthesis of survey and observational data by forest health specialists.

This relationship is defined by collecting many flow measurements over a range of stage, plotting these points and fitting a line through it using a standard equation. There are practical considerations in drawing rating curves and constraints on the parameters which make constructing rating curves in commonly available software like Excel very difficult. So we contracted Northwest Hydraulic Consultants (NHC) to create an app using Python which allows a user to upload their field data measurements of stage and discharge and the app will fit a statistical curve to the data. This is meant to be a simple and elegant solution for data collectors whose budget does not support the purchase or licensing of specialized software for this purpose. In our work with 3rd party data collectors (stewardship groups and First Nations) we have frequently found this to be a capacity gap in the ability of smaller organizations to produce useable data. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe app does not store any personal information it ingests only date/time, stage, discharge, uncertainty and notes. The data which is uploaded is transient and is lost once the user leaves the site. The uploaded data can be used to statistically fit a rating curve or some more advanced features are offered. The tool is intended to be used by people who have taken the provincial training program which has been largely developed and is starting to be delivered around the province.

To support transparency, the ministry proposed requiring all composting facilities exempted from permits, approvals, or operational certificates, to follow a registration process instead of a notification process. The applicant would be required to submit plans, reports, and specifications, and any pertinent information requested by a director, as part of the registration process.

The maps can be used as a regional forest management tool to highlight or flag areas of varying karst potential, and can be considered a coarse upper-level filter for directing detailed inventories and for assisting in higher level planning and decision making.  The maps have a number of limitations, the most important being the lack of field verification for karst within the various geological units.

During this phase, an electronic software application was developed to move the data from the current provincial SIBEC DW to a new SIBEC Reporting Data Mart (RDM).

Staff build the parcel and manipulate it as they negotiate the term with the client. Once an agreement is reached SPS deposits the information in PTS. **************INFORMATION FLOW:**************** Industry submits requests to have parcels description information generated to go up for auction.  The branch staff receive this by fax, email, or phone and manually enter it into SPS. SPS then generates a file which is manually copied via FTP to a file share on the EARTH mainframe server where PTS is located using the PTS useraccount to do so.  Alternatively industry members can submit these requests through  the PTOnline website [PTO]. PTO parcel requests are then transferred to SPS one time per monthly auction period. PTO can also transfer information from SPS to PTSA or from PTS to PTSA. After the initial set of auction requests come in and SPS has entered all the manual submissions and posted the file on the EARTH FTP share, branch staff will use a desktop Application Smart Term to access PTS and import the file that was submitted from SPS.  Change to the Parcel requests can also be made either manually through SPS, or through PTOnline, but PTO changes need to be updated manually in SPS and PTS. To identify changes a PTO report is run showing the parcel request changes.  SPS is limited in that it cannot only view the current Parcel description. So branch staff use ArcMap and a Python script to bring together some tables and spatial information from PTA/PTSA to create one (Read-only) feature class. This allows the viewing each date that information was submitted by staff through SPS and PTS.\\n\\r\\n\\rHistorically belonging to: Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, Oil and Gas Division, Tenure and Geoscience Branch, Tenure and Revenue Management\",\n",
