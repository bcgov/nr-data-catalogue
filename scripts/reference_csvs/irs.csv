Until 1988, the Province of BC maintained provincial soils field data in a mainframe computer application called `BC Soil Information System` (BCSIS).  At that time, monetary and personnel constraints forced the system to be archived.  Efforts began in 1995 to regain access to this valuable data set with initial funding provided by the Corporate Resource Inventory Initiative and later Forest Renewal BC.
In the mid 90`s, a web-based search application was built to provide soil and morphological information from a mainframe database.  It was built to capture `site` data & soils data to go with the vegetation information captured in BCVIS (Vegetation).  To date, all data has been downloaded from the mainframe and imported into the Ministry`s database software `ORACLE`.  The information held in BCSIS consists of site descriptions, soil horizon data, and laboratory analysis results. In 2010 the Web Application was retired. The data remains in the BC Geographic Warehouse, and on the LAN is various other formats, and is available for download.

ALSO, from Scott Sharp:
CEF does have scripts in the ISSS FME Servers.  They do not have a budget/vendor to maintain them though.  The NRS Staging area is \\spatialfiles.bcgov\work\!staging.  There has not been activity for years but all of the pieces still exist in the databases, file servers and FME Servers.

They do have a footprint on the geospatial file servers.  I have recently worked with the GIS CEF staff to setup and secure their different subfolders at \\spatialfiles.bcgov\work\srm\bcce.  The archive subfolder is actually in object storage via a DFS mount point to a geodrive share.  The other subfolders are on traditional file servers.  They have a lot of data!

The CEF is designed to improve the assessment and management of cumulative effects in natural resource decision making in B.C.

It may be working versions, not fully modelled and/or proposed for custodial sign-off. Basically the Coverage Finder is a search engine for this data that is stored in \\giswhse.env.gov.bc.ca\whse_np otherwise known as ArcLib. The architecture is moderatly complex in that it has a number of components. 1. A cron job (on ssbux2) that calls a shell script 2. The shell script calls an ArcInfo AML script 3. The ArcInfo code traverses the ArcLib directory structure and captures metadata 4. The metadata is written into Oracle tables in CORPWHSE schema, MSTWHSE instance. 5. The Coverage Finder runs as a web app using mod_plsql and a DAD with a pseudo user id 6. The Coverage Finder app is an executable package: corpwhse.findcov@mstwhse

This stayed with what is NRIDS when GeoBC split back in ~2010. It was then retired and holds no value. Annika Livingston is probably the only person who remembers this.

Description of the site - C-Guide is government`s `one stop shop` for guidance, resources and tools respecting the Province`s obligations to consult First Nations.

The Updated Procedures for Meeting Legal Obligations when Consulting First Nations (Updated Procedures) is the central piece of guidance on this site. While the Updated Procedures is a public document, many of the documents, tools and resources on this site are confidential and intended for use by government staff only. C-guide is maintained by the Strategic Consultation Initiatives Division of the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation.

CGUIDE hosts information and training for FNP(PIP), ARTS, and FNCS. Audience of this is all provincial government (IDIR ALL).

July 22, 2024 Update - Content from the Drupal version of C-Guide (https://cguide.nrs.gov.bc.ca/?) has been moved over to a CMS Lite instance of C-Guide (https://intranet.gov.bc.ca/nrs/building-solutions-together/consultation-guide-c-guide). There is some work required to ensure all content has been moved over. The work will be undertaken in August 2024.

Once content has been confirmed to have been moved over correctly, all DRUPAL instances (DEL, TEST, PROD) can be deleted. In addition, given that the new site is CMS Lite, this IRS record can be deleted as NRIDS will no longer have to treat the Intranet site as an application (i.e. delete this record).",,"Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship","Reconciliation, Lands and Natural Resource Policy Division",NRS Reconciliation Policy and Strategies,N/A,LW

Will provide access to exact copies of data assets residing in Line of Business databases, as well as data constructs (views, materialized views); that will be refreshed on pre-defined schedules (nightly by default, other schedules by exception). Data consumption against this database will be intended for traditional reporting.

Data Lakehouse (DLH) - 

Will provide access to summarized copies of data assets originally replicated to the ODS; with the exclusive purpose of producing analytics and business intelligence artifacts, including Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The Data Lakehouse will allow for the transformation and combination of structured and semi-structured data, including the consumption of public Data APIs and Object Storage.

These databases are currently in the Design Phase and are expected to become available to early adopters in the first quarter of 2024.

Onboarding to these databases will require data custodians, report publishers and report consumers to work together to establish data classification, metadata, replication and data transformation mechanisms and security access roles.

NRM Data Foundations will provide support and establish rules for data publication to this platform. Please reach out to NRM.DataFoundations@gov.bc.ca for more information.

Added Sept 1, 2021
The Data Acquisition System (DAS) is a Commercial Off the Shelf system that is used to acquire, store, and publish ambient air quality and meteorological data from monitoring stations throughout the Province of British Columbia. Data is collected from monitoring stations maintained by the Ministry and is augmented by monitoring data collected by permittees (industry), BC Hydro, Prince Rupert Port Authority and Metro Vancouver. DAS facilitates reporting, analysis and sharing of ambient air quality and meteorological data for policy and decision-making, scientific research, and public reporting web and application interfaces. The system is deemed mission critical (particularly during the summer and fire season and winter valley inversions) and is vital to the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategys environmental monitoring and reporting responsibilities.

It is the mandate of the Public Affairs Branch to inform the public of the status of the environment.  To do this effectively and cost efficiently Public Affairs must understand the interests and concerns of individuals within the public.  Broadcasting all publications and information to all members of the public is a wasteful process that goes against environmental common sense.  DMS allows Public Affairs to identify interests within the public and to direct relevant publications to those interested parties in a cost-effective manner.  DMS will enable Public Affairs to more effectively inform and respond to the public with an overall reduction in cost.

The system was developed using the Oracle CASE tools, database and development environment.  As such, it is an open system easily ported into a variety of platforms.  Currently it is developed in a host-based mode which allows access from a wide variety of platforms.

ESF,Electronic Submission Framework,"The ESF application is a combination of technology, tools, and a website that allows clients of the Natural Resource Ministries to submit data electronically to their line-of-business application.
Data submissions are done using an XML file (Extensible Markup Language). Both attribute and spatial data can be submitted using a single XML file. Spatial data is embedded in the receiving application using GML (Geography Markup Language). 

How this works. ESF validates the structure of the document submitted by checking it against the appropriate (submission-specific) XML schema. An ESF schema is very similar to the schema of a database. The schema dictates data type, size and mandatory fields of a record. Like a database, an XML document can contain many records.

To make a data submission, clients log on to the ESF web site and upload an XML document. If the document does not pass the schema validation, the user will be notified on upload. Once a document is validated, it will be passed to the appropriate business system, where detailed line-of-business specific rules are applied. If the business rules fail, a message will be sent back to the client asking the client to fix the data and resubmit it to ESF.

Most problems with data uploads occur on the receiving line-of-business application (business rule validation due to application changes or interruption of ESF service requiring a business application restart).

FHMAP,Forest Health Online - RETIRED,"**Retired on Dec 3rd, 2010 requested by Mark Jousi**
Since 1999, the B.C. Ministry of Forests has surveyed the majority of the forested land in the province using the classic sketch mapping technique known as the the overview survey method.  The purpose of the survey is to record and report the general trends in disturbance patterns across the provincial forested land base (including provincial parks, private land, and Tree Farm Licences but not Federal parks).  The survey has been a key source of data documenting the development of the current mountain pine beetle outbreak in the interior of B.C.  Data from the BC MOF survey is also comparable to data collected from 1914 to 1995 by the Canadian Forest Service`s former Forest Insect and Disease Survey Unit (FIDS) and to US Forest Service, Forest Health monitoring surveys.  This model provides spatial data to the current and past conditions reported by the survey, the survey methods and other supporting information

The four spatial layers in the Forest health Model are described as follows:

1. Pest Infestation polygon - Polygons depict the  severity of detected forest health factors (pests) using the aerial and ground forest health surveys by area.  Themes are displayed by pest species and by the year of data collection. Feature type : polygon multipart.
2. Pest Infestation Overview polygon - A generalized version of the Pest Infestation Polygon layer.  Feature type : polygon multipart.
3. Pest Infestation points - Points depict the location of detected forest health factors (pests) using the aerial and ground forest health surveys.  Themes are displayed by pest species and by the year of data collection. Feature type : point.
4. Pest Hazard - This theme depicts that relative susceptibility (hazard) of forested areas to damage by pests.  The hazard polygons are generated using various means ranging from biogeoclimatic zonation and degree-day accumulations, to professional opinion based on the synthesis of survey and observational data by forest health specialists. Feature type : polygon multipart.

The project is to develop a laptop based application for the collection of hydrometric field data.

The app would allow historical data to be downloaded from the Aquarius Cloud to a portable database.  Access to historical data assists in field work, as current measurements are always compared against historical to determine issues in the field.  The app would provide user interface field form to enter measurement and station data and meta-data  (like maintenance, calibration data etc).  Back in the office the app would interface with the Aqaurius cloud to import the new data into the database.  Data stored on the portable app would be static and would work offline, as field work may be out of range of mobile data.

HYDRA,Hydrometric Rating Curve,"The rating curve, sometimes called a rating model, is a plotted relationship between stage (datum referenced water level) and discharge (volumetric flow). This relationship is defined by collecting many flow measurements over a range of stage, plotting these points and fitting a line through it using a standard equation. There are practical considerations in drawing rating curves and constraints on the parameters which make constructing rating curves in commonly available software like Excel very difficult. So we contracted Northwest Hydraulic Consultants (NHC) to create an app using Python which allows a user to upload their field data measurements of stage and discharge and the app will fit a statistical curve to the data. This is meant to be a simple and elegant solution for data collectors whose budget does not support the purchase or licensing of specialized software for this purpose. In our work with 3rd party data collectors (stewardship groups and First Nations) we have frequently found this to be a capacity gap in the ability of smaller organizations to produce useable data. 

The app does not store any personal information it ingests only date/time, stage, discharge, uncertainty and notes. The data which is uploaded is transient and is lost once the user leaves the site. The uploaded data can be used to statistically fit a rating curve or some more advanced features are offered. The tool is intended to be used by people who have taken the provincial training program which has been largely developed and is starting to be delivered around the province. At this time we have not looked into restricting access, so anyone with the weblink could use the site.

- Client software hosted on various Citrix servers running Intella View, using one licence per user, reading cases from the Intella Manager on TCP port 8080-8100 (one port per case)
- License managers on each of the Intella Viewer terminal servers, and the Intella Manager server address (on TCP port 1947) an Aladdin Sentinel service managing keys off a HASP dongle, installed on the Intella Manager server.  
- Each server must have an Aladdin Sentinel HASP license client installed, and have firewall rules in place to allow the necessary port access.
- The App Admin must use the IDIR\ENVINTLA account to login and share cases on the Intella Manager server, to prevent their own account password expiration from causing the sharing to fail. IDIR\ENVINTLA password must be change at least twice a year, and the new password given to Apps Delivery over the phone.

MYRA,My Range Application,"The new range system is called My Range Application (MyRA) which contains two components including a line of business (LoB) application and a mobile application (MOB.)

MOB: this externally focused component enables clients who use hand-held mobile devices to utilize the NRS Mobile Enablement infrastructure that provisions an automated, client-driven, online completion of a Range Use Plan (RUP) application and administration of them. Upload/download functionality enables  tenure applicants and agreement holders to successfully self-manage their range tenures. The system securely provides disconnected mobile capability to build or amend a RUP in the field and provides connected mobile capability with the LoB application for upload/download of RUP information from the field or office/home.  Other specified natural resource systems datasets are also available via download for client RUP decision making within the MOB functionality.

LoB: this internally focused component is used by ministry staff for recording statutory decisions and day to day maintenance of supporting and managing the range use plans built on the mobile application. The use of client portal built on the NRS Online Services platform allows the ability for clients to register and securely log on to view existing range use plans, and submit amendments to RUP?s.  The ministry portal allows the ability for staff to send an amendment back to the proponent for clarification, manage the amendment workflow, and recommend an outcome for an amendment.

Object Storage can be accessed in a similar fashion to a shared drive, and also programmatically with the REST API. Use of the API is encouraged to streamline data transfer between applications and Object Storage.

Data put into Object Storage is mirrored between Calgary and Kamloops, with a failover function in the event that one data center is unavailable. The latency of the system itself is estimated at ~100ms, but this does not account for network latency. Applications dependent on quick response times from storage are better served by SAN Storage.

ORI pulls it`s data from EMA (also known as AMS) hosted on the shared infrastructure).

The Organic Matter Recycling Regulation (OMRR) governs the construction and operation of compost facilities, as well as the production, distribution, storage, sale, and use of biosolids and compost. OMRR is currently undergoing amendments to enhance its effectiveness in human and environment health protection. The most recent intentions paper (IP) proposes increased transparency and enhancement of Indigenous engagement. To support transparency, the ministry proposed requiring all composting facilities exempted from permits, approvals, or operational certificates, to follow a registration process instead of a notification process. The applicant would be required to submit plans, reports, and specifications, and any pertinent information requested by a director, as part of the registration process. The submitted information would then be made publicly available. This information and its posting would be subject to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA).  

The primary objective of this project is to develop and implement a comprehensive approach that fulfills the Ministry`s commitments to increased transparency and enhanced Indigenous engagement under the OMRR. This initiative focuses on the land application of class B compost and class A and class B biosolids, as well as the operations of composting facilities not otherwise undergoing permitting processes.

Comment 2021-04-01
PAE was developed to provide information to the public on permit applications and active permits within the provincial parks system. Our staff are required to post information on permit applications and the electronic park use permit system (ePUPs, part of the eLicensing platform) was updated in 2017 to push information on permit applications online to PAE.

of land and water throughout coastal and mainland British Columbia, offering
ecological, scientific, social, cultural, and economic benefits.This model was developed to track and maintain the status of these areas. This also has a warehouse model called PA(R)_WHSE

Solution Purpose:
- PAR is the single central database source of fundamental information on the BC Parks system. It tracks changes to the system as well as current and historical legal changes to the system. 
- PAR is used to track, research and query the system of protected areas. It is the source of system statistics for reporting out Provincially, Nationally and Internationally on the BC Parks protected area system.
- Without PAR we would lose the ability to track, query and report out on the BC Parks system on the whole. For example, twice a year we use the information stored in PAR to meet a request from Environment Canada to report out on the area protected in the province. The attribution needed to meet this request is provided by PAR.",https://erstudio.nrs.gov.bc.ca/getDiagImage.spg?image=b1d0aae4f02f4e24b1b58a338620a25f,Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy,Conservation and Recreation,Provincial Services,Planning and Land Administration,STD

QuickWINS,Quick Water Information Sharing System,"QuickWINS is an application for editing and storage of water licensing data. The QuickWINS application manages some spatial elements of the Provincial water rights data.

It is an ArcGIS Online (AGO) application. 

Only PROD application; no TEST instance for application layer but there is a TEST for replication.

QuickWINS is comprised of three application components:
1. Online editing, 
2. Python translation/staging, and 
3. ETL to BCGW. 

1. The online editing component resides on ESRI ArcGIS Online (cloud) platform. ArcGIS Online Feature services containing data for linear licensed works, point licensed works, and water reservations are edited daily by FLNRO Geomatics and Water Authorizations staff edit using in a web map application (Quick WINS). 

Application users edit spatial data using a ArcGIS online webapp with and editor interface. Application access is controlled through ArcGIS online group sharing using a group called ENV - WINS Upgrade project. Data is symbolized by FEATURE_CODE coded domains with descriptive text on four editable spatial datasets:
	Licensed works  Points
	Licensed works  Lines
	Reserves and Restrictions
	Designated Flood Areas
	Non-Trim Hydrography

2. Nightly at 2100 a Python script is run using a task scheduler. The python application component downloads from ArcGIS online the feature service to perform data schema translations, quality assurance, and validation with license data stored in BCGW before moving data to a DataBC file server(data.bcgov) for staging area. 

3. A DataBC managed ETL service picks up the data every night for loading to BCGW for the spatial feature services.  It takes data from BC Map Hub & stages it on a file server for BCGW replication by FME (DataBC).

REC,Recreation Resources Inventory (MoFR),"Recreation Inventory Logical Model is a logically representation
of the three Inventories described below. VLI has three inventories plus a couple materialized views. The RFI and ROS have one each plus some materialized views.  These inventories are replicated to the BCGW.

Visual Landscape Inventory
The purpose of the Visual Landscape Inventory is to provide
information about the visual condition, characteristics and 
sensitivity to alteration of areas and corridors throughout the 
province. This information is intended to assist land use 
planners and resource managers in deciding appropriate
land uses, resource development objectives and 
management prescriptions. 



Recreation Features Inventory
A recreation features inventory is the identification, classification
and recording of amenity, cultural and historic values on Crown Land.
It consists of carrying out a number of steps, which includes:
familiarization with the study area (air photo interpretation, map 
reading, etc.);  
solicitation of public and agency input; 
delineation of recreation polygons; 
identification of key recreation features and activities; 
field verification of polygons, features and activities;  
completion of inventory checklists;  
completion of an inventory report;  
digitizing the map; data entry; quality assurance testing; 
and data storage/retrieval. 



Recreation Opportunity Spectrum inventory
A Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) inventory is the 
identification, recording and classification of the current state 
of naturalness, remoteness and expected social experience 
on areas of Crown Land. This inventory may be carried out 
on all lands for continuity of data. However, recreation 
inventory and analysis information applies only to Crown 
Land. ROS is identified and recorded on a hard-copy map 
and inventory checklist, then digitized and data entered, for 
inclusion in the corporate database.

ROS is represented by mixes or combinations of settings, 
and probable experience opportunities which have been 
arranged along a spectrum or continuum. This continuum 
is comprised of eight ROS classes: 
Primitive (P); Semi-primitive Non-Motorized (SPNM); 
Semi-primitive Motorized (SPM); Natural (N); Natural Roaded (NR); 
Modified Roaded (MR); Rural (R) and Urban (U). 
Figure 1 (below) shows how the ROS classes relate to each 
other along a continuum on the basis of naturalness and remoteness.

RKPM,Reconnaissance Karst Potential Mapping,"DataBC

The presently completed karst potential maps should be considered preliminary and have yet to undergo any significant testing by users.  The maps can be used as a regional forest management tool to highlight or flag areas of varying karst potential, and can be considered a coarse upper-level filter for directing detailed inventories and for assisting in higher level planning and decision making.  The maps have a number of limitations, the most important being the lack of field verification for karst within the various geological units.  It is anticipated that revised versions of this mapping might be completed periodically to make refinements and improvements.  Compilation of the maps and data in a digital format will greatly assist in making these refinements.
 
This type of map differs from a simple karst map, which would display features and characteristics of only the known karst locations.  Background details on the karst forming processes, the distribution of karst in British Columbia, and karst ecosystems are included in the KISP document (Stokes and Griffiths, 1998).

SPS,Sales Parcel System,"The Sales Parcel System(SPS) is an add-on to the PTS and manages industry requests for oil & gas rights information. Staff build the parcel and manipulate it as they negotiate the term with the client. Once an agreement is reached SPS deposits the information in PTS. **************INFORMATION FLOW:**************** Industry submits requests to have parcels description information generated to go up for auction.  The branch staff receive this by fax, email, or phone and manually enter it into SPS. SPS then generates a file which is manually copied via FTP to a file share on the EARTH mainframe server where PTS is located using the PTS useraccount to do so.  Alternatively industry members can submit these requests through  the PTOnline website [PTO]. PTO parcel requests are then transferred to SPS one time per monthly auction period. PTO can also transfer information from SPS to PTSA or from PTS to PTSA. After the initial set of auction requests come in and SPS has entered all the manual submissions and posted the file on the EARTH FTP share, branch staff will use a desktop Application Smart Term to access PTS and import the file that was submitted from SPS.  Change to the Parcel requests can also be made either manually through SPS, or through PTOnline, but PTO changes need to be updated manually in SPS and PTS. To identify changes a PTO report is run showing the parcel request changes.  SPS is limited in that it cannot only view the current Parcel description. So branch staff use ArcMap and a Python script to bring together some tables and spatial information from PTA/PTSA to create one (Read-only) feature class. This allows the viewing each date that information was submitted by staff through SPS and PTS.

TIPSY,Table Interpolation for Stand Yields,"TIPSY (Table Interpolation for Stand Yields) is a publically distributed PC-based growth and yield program that provides user friendly access to managed stand yield tables generated by TASS and SYLTER.   TIPSY retrieves and interpolates yield tables from its database, customizes the information and displays summaries and graphics for a specific site, species and management regime. Yield tables are available for all 10 commercial tree species supported by TASS.
TIPSY has been in operational use since 1991, and continues to be the primary vehicle for most operational applications of TASS in BC.

Solution Purpose:
Uses the output from TASS to generate yield tables to derive value of the data gathered from TASS. Most utilized tool for timber supply.

------------------

Programming is undertaken on the TIPSY applications using C programming, Microsoft Visual C, C++, and OpenGL.
Enfor has provided software programming in all these languages for TIPSY projects and will continue as needed for software development and maintenance.  

New development is recommended to proceed using Microsoft VB.Net 4.8 or higher.  We have also prepared help files using RoboHelp (though this is a challenging application and really should be transitioned to another help application), Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat.
Interactive TIPSY and BatchTIPSY are older applications written in C/C++ using Visual Studio 2015.  Since 2008, Enfor has provided updates in C/C++ as needed to the update existing features and user interface.
OpenGL was used prior to 2008 on an application known as Vista(s), which used to be linked to TASS via DDE.
The following applications are written in Visual Basic using Visual Studio 2015 and the Microsoft .Net Framework version 4.8:
	BatchTIPSY Composer.  The Help file was prepared in Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat (for later conversion to RoboHelp if the client requires).
	FAN$IER.
	Plotsy 1 and Plotsy 2
	SiteTools
	TIPSY to Carbon Budget Model (CBM-CFS3) link.

TIPSY_BTC,BatchTIPSY Composer,"The Batch TIPSY Composer is being developed as part of the TIPSY suite of programs to allow users to generate managed stand yield tables more efficiently in batch mode. It consolidates related TIPSY programs that have been under development.

An updated interface will be optimized for working with large data sets, with results previewed in a tabular or graphical format. Users will navigate quickly between stands and between batch, composer and interactive views. Users will more readily assess managed stand growth and yield attributes for VRI and other inventory polygons for use in TSR work.

Note:  
BatchTIPSY is the batch application that can be used from within TIPSY.

BatchTIPSY Composer is a batch application recently developed for FAIBs analyst section for TSR use.  This application has a different input interface and some other options not in BatchTIPSY.

BatchTIPSY Composer with an updated Plotsy application was released with in the TIPSY4.5 download/installation package. BatchTIPSY Composer shows up as a separate icon/program from TIPSY, whereas to access BatchTIPSY you would typically go through the TIPSY menu.

TMS,Tenure Map Service,"The TMS application differs from a standard IMF application as it does not 
use the IMF as its primary interface. TMS is started from the Ministry of

work using the standard IMF tools and some custom tools that are also hosted 
by the TMS application running at MOF.

Once the user has completed their work the can then return to the TMS 
application from the IMF application.

Because of this relationship, the only file(s) that need to be deployed to

VDYP,Variable Density Yield Projection,"The Variable Density Yield Projection System (VDYP7) is a key component of the provincial Vegetation Resource Inventory (VRI) and is embedded in a number of corporate Ministry systems.  The VDYP 7 system is used to keep the VRI current for forest growth, greatly reducing the need for costly  field  re-inventory.

VDYP Compiles VRI data from various sources accessed through the Results Data Warehouse (RWD. RDW is maintained by the Forest Analysis inventory Branch. 

The VDYP System, as distributed it is strictly a series of libraries (DLLs) with a small number of client side programs that run on top of it (WinVDYP7, VDYP7Batch and VDYP7Console).

The intention, up to now, is that the client wishing to use this software, installs it locally on their machine and uses it locally.  

There is absolutely no client-server aspect to VDYP7.

From a technical perspective, the client installation process uses archaic Windows installation standards and the application does not take advantage of newer best-practices such as the use of the `LocalData` folder found on newer versions of Windows for the storage of configuration and run-time temporary data.  This approach causes problems for distribution to MoF Laptops where the folders that can be written to by a local application are locked down and so exceptions have to be made for those situations or a non-automated installation has to be performed.

The WFNEWS application provides current fire-related information to the public and allows BCWS Comms staff to manage the information that is available for public access.

A small number of BCWS employees have add/edit access, and the general public has read access.

There are two main components:

First, a responsive-designed, non-authenticated public application that can be run from any browser on either desktop or mobile devices.  On mobile devices it can also be run as a stand-alone app that can be downloaded from the IOS App Store or the Android Play Store. The stand-alone version supports the submission of off-line Reports of Fire.

Second, an IDIR-authenticated Admin interface that allows BCWS Comms staff to manage current fire-related information that is accessible to the public.

The WFNEWS application is cloud-based using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and utilizes specialized technologies to provide cross-platform mobile support and cloud-based messaging:

1. Ionic Framework, an open-source mobile UI toolkit (https://ionicframework.com/)
2. Capacitor, a cross-platform native runtime for mobile web apps (https://capacitorjs.com/)
3. Firebase Cloud Messaging, a cross-platform messaging and notification service for mobile apps (https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging)

The WFNEWS app communicates with WFIM through a sync API that utilizes an ActiveMQ queue to ensure that incident information being presented to the public is up-to-date. 

The WFNEWS app also utilizes a scalable cloud-based PostgreSQL database and aggressive caching to handle the volume of users accessing the application during peak fire season.

NOTE: The `OLD Public (Public Mobile)` URLs will be active until people stop using the PM stand-alone app.  My understanding is that they will continue to work for some time until BCWS decides the number of users is so small that we shut that down for good and the PM app stops working for those who have not upgraded to WFNEWS.",,Ministry of Forests,BC Wildfire Service,N/A,N/A,STD

WFWX,Wildfire Weather,"Wildfire Weather application suite

Over time, it will replace the legacy weather and lightning systems (see FWXSYS) for collection, processing, and display of weather-related (including lightning) data.

External Service: Vaisala (for lightning feed)
External Service: MeteoStar SFTP (for Image Writer API)

The data-writer component which is used to pull data from AutoCaller, CRD, and ECCC (Environment Canada) is deployed only on the single PINNACLE node, whereas all other components are deployed across multiple nodes. 

Note: AutoCaller is still located on SQL Server; see FWXSYS entry which covers this application.

The system uses FME (on server TRANSLATE) to generate hourly reading reports for external public users (datamart FTP site) and for secure users (Environment Canada, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium [PCIC], and Meteostar)

Data is also published to the WFJCRS (WFBI) application via an hourly FME job (most likely - double check with Kevin Guise).  Only the 5 most recent years of data are available directly through the WFWX system; for older data analysis, users will use WFBI.

SFMS maps are sourced from bcwsdata.nrs.bcgov/sfms_archive$

Lightning data is captured within an extended bounding box, rather than just the provincial boundaries. The extended bounding box of lightning data is only retained for a configured number of weeks (default 3 weeks). An FME job runs daily to trim the lightning data and reduce the dataset to lightning strokes within 20km of the provincial boundary.",,Ministry of Forests,BC Wildfire Service,N/A,N/A,STD

ArcGIS Online Feature services containing data for linear licensed works, point licensed works, and water reservations are edited daily by FLNRO Geomatics and Water Authorizations staff edit using in a web map application (Quick WINS). The python application component downloads the feature service data nightly at 2100 to perform data schema translations, quality assurance, and validation with license data stored in BCGW before moving data to a DataBC file server(data.bcgov) for staging. A DataBC managed ETL service picks up the data every night for loading to BCGW.
